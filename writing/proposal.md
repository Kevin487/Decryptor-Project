# Useful Tool for Spies

## Description of the Main Idea

The idea of this project is to form a program that will be able to encrypt a string of text that is inputed then decrypt it. The encryption of the string of text will be unreadable and unrecognizable to people that try to read it. Additionally, this program will also offer the capabilities to decrypt the messages inputed into this program that became encrypted. Therefore, this program will be a useful tool for people that are trying to send secret messages.

For example, this program can make an encryption key program that accepts messages from a user, encrypts it, then decrypts it using a cipher. This process means that the main component of the process of encryption and decrypting comes from the use of a cipher. The program will encrypt the message then print out a cipher, decrypt the cipher, then print out the message that was encrypted decrypted.


## Description of the Tasks that You Will Complete

The task we will complete will be to accept a string of text that we will then encrypt and turn into a cypher. Once the text has been encrypted and turned into a cypher we will then take that cypher and decrypt it back into a readable string.
